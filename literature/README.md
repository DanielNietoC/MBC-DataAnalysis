# Scientific Literature

Here you will find the pdf's of the articles based on the datasets that we will be using during the course. Take some time to read them and get familiar with the point of the research and the type of data and methods being used. Don't worry if you don't fully understand it yet. Do not worry much about the analyses. Instead, focus on the point of the study, the description of the data, and the conclusions. We will get to the analyses through the course.
